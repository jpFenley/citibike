# Citibike Weather

In 2013, Citibike arrived to NYC. It is currently the largest bikeshare program in North America, having over 100 milliion trips carried out. This ride data is available for each month, indicating the ride start and end positions, time, and other factors. By combining the data with historic weather data, ridership can be analyzed respect to weather. We expect to see larger more macro trends such as seasonality as well as shorter-term cycles affecting ridership such as precipitation. Additional transportation data such as Uber rides, subway, and taxi usage can be incorporated as well if needed.

The analysis of bike usage based on weather can help predict usership trends in new cities deploying similar programs as well as helping to determine the necessary supply of bikes that should be made available. Previous literature analyzes the impact of weather on Citibike usage, but often fails to account for the increase in available bikes and stations or changes between multiple years. The effect of COVID-19 on the program is beyond the scope of this paper. The analysis should help determine climatic patterns that affect ridership as well as possibly detect inefficiencies in how the Citibike program is managed.
